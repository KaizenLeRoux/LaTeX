	\section{Purpose}
		The purpose of this plan is to ensure that all requirements in terms of ECSA outcomes are met, in the minimum amount of time of five years, by future candidate engineer Mr Pierre Le Roux (13112262) which will be referred to in this paper as FCE.
		The plan will cover the following:
		
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item	Registering at ECSA as a Professional Industrial Engineer
		
		\item	Completing one five year cycle of Continuous Professional Development (CPD)
		\end{enumerate}
		
		This plan isn't perfect and as circumstances change the plan will be rescheduled accordingly while still ensure that the FCE achieves said outcomes.
		
	\section{Directions}
		During the FCE's studies automation, simulation, operations research, processes and production automation peaks his interest. 
		The FCE's final year project , Improving FlySafair's Crew Scheduling, is an operations research project which combines programming, heuristics and modelling to create a more automated system the insures to generate a more optimal schedule for FlySafair.
		
	
	\section{Commitments}
		The FCE's has not commitments to a third party in terms of completing his B.Ing. degree.
		While it is fortunate that the FCE doesn't have any contractual requirement in terms of employment, but on the other hand the FCE will need to find employment to ensure he can complete the requirements in terms of the eleven ECSA outcomes and completing activities for CPD credits - Developmental, work-based and individual. The FCE hopes that FlySafair would provide work for him based on the results of his final year project.
